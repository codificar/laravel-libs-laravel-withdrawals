## Prerequisites

- These middwares are needed:
- If your project does not have some of these middleware, it is necessary to add them.
```

auth.provider
auth.provider_api:api
```
- The following tables are required. The columns are the same as in the UBER CLONE project:
```
Provider

```

## Getting Started


Add in composer.json:

```php
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://libs:ofImhksJ@git.codificar.com.br/laravel-libs/laravel-withdrawals.git"
    }
]
```

```php
require:{
        "codificar/withdrawals": "0.1.0",
}
```

```php
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "Codificar\\Withdrawals\\": "vendor/codificar/withdrawals/src/"
    }
}
```

```

Register the service provider in `config/app.php`:

   */
  Codificar\Withdrawals\WithdrawalsServiceProvider::class,
],
```

    "scripts": {
        //...
		"post-autoload-dump": [
			"@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=public_vuejs_libs --force"
		]
	},
